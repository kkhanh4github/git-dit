Issues
======

Commonly, in bug- and issue-tracking systems, the term "issue" refers to a
problem or a question. More recently, "issue" may also refer to a feature or
other request. However, we use the term "issue" more broadly.

In the context of git-dit, the term issue refers to a topic, concern or matter
concerning a project's source code, covering:

 * feature requests,
 * bug reports
 * patch sets

As in other issue trackers, an issue in git-dit has a status, an author and a
creation time. Is may also have additional metadata.
